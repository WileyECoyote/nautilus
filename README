This is the Rampage version of Nautilus, the file manager.

Preface
============

This is yet another version of the Nautilus file manager, this one is
like no other. The orginal source was started as a fork from nautilus
version 3.4.2, which included the path in each pane and other features
missing from new versions. File managers installed with non-gnome desktop
environments were unacceptable. I wanted My Nautilus, but not to provide
a "desktop" just as a file manager. Using the "no-desktop" switch was
clumbersome, so I began hacking using the "best" semi-stable version.
Two months later the first edition of the Nautilus Rampage was born.

This is a file Manager only; the Rampage edition does not provide a
desktop. The notion of the system's file manager doubling as a Desktop
provider was an ill-concieved idea, copied from MS windows by Eazel,
aka ex-apples, in a failed attempt to monetizing online services to be
offered through Nautilus, i.e. pushing advertising directly onto user's
Desktop. About the same time, MS was getting beat-up by the DOJ and
backed-offed on their approach. The idea of using a file manager as a
Desktop provider has since propagated on the Linux platform.

Other features of the Rampage edition include:

   The location of Path is user configuable and can be displayed either
   seperately in each pane like the old nautilus or in the toolbar like
   newer versions (requires a restart).

   The sidebar can be toggle between a tree-view or a places-view.

   The zoom can be adjusted for each pane.

   The tree-view and file panes have independent configuable tool-tips
   with adjustable time-outs.

   The Rampage edition has more configuable options than other nautilus
   variants.

   Builds with Gtk+-2.0 and glib v2.32.
